> **Love to Learn Languages.**

We’re changing how people experience language learning: not as a boring chore or textbook memorization, but as a fun, emotionally engaging game that makes you *talk, think, and feel* in your target language.

---

### Pain

Language learning is hard, demotivating, and rarely results in speaking confidence. Apps like Duolingo and courses focus on grammar and vocabulary drills but leave users unable to hold a real conversation. Traditional methods are expensive, stressful, and time-consuming.

> “I’ve learned Spanish for 3 years in my Abitur and I still fail to speak more that a few starter sentences. And I can not hold even a basic converstaion with a native.”

**Emotional Problem:**
Learners often feel embarrassed to speak, isolated and stuck in a loop of passive learning. It’s not fun, and it doesn’t stick.
