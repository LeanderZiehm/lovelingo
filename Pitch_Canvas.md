The Pitch Canvas©

Simple Statement of what change you and your product are making in the world.
A memorable one-sentence explanation of what you do for customers.

Pain (+ Gain)
What problem are you solving for your customers?
What does the pain result in?
Can you make the pain a human problem, that everyone can relate to?
How many people need this problem solved - market size?
Have you validated that people will pay to have it solved?

Product
As simply as possible: How does it work?
What does your product do for customers?
What can your customers do as a result of your product?
What opportunities do you provide for people to be faster, more cost-effective, more efficient, happier, safer?
How have you tested it with customers?
(Be sure not to let the product dominate the pitch.)

Product Demo
Live demo? (always risky, but powerful if it works...)
A screenflow movie of a working App convinces this is for real.
Physical product convinces you can execute.
Screenshots are also OK, but can look like a mock-up - moving product on screen is better.
Can you show a real customer using it?

Why You?

How has your life been affected by this industry?
