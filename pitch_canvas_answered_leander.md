The Pitch Canvas©

Simple Statement of what change you and your product are making in the world.
A memorable one-sentence explanation of what you do for customers.
#Answer:
Lovelingo:Learn to Love Speaking new Languages.

Pain (+ Gain)
What problem are you solving for your customers?
What does the pain result in?
Can you make the pain a human problem, that everyone can relate to?
How many people need this problem solved - market size?
Have you validated that people will pay to have it solved?
#Answer:
Language learning is hard, demotivating, and rarely results in speaking confidence.
 Apps like Duolingo and courses focus on grammar and vocabulary drills but leave users unable to hold a real conversation. Traditional methods are expensive, stressful, and time-consuming.

“I’ve learned Spanish for 3 years in my Abitur and I still fail to speak more that a few starter sentences. And I can not hold even a basic converstaion with a native.”
Emotional Problem:
Learners often feel embarrassed to speak, isolated, and stuck in a loop of passive learning. It’s not fun, and it doesn’t stick.

Market Size:
1.5 billion people are currently learning a new language.
Duolingo: 97M monthly active users, $531M revenue (2023).
We aim for 50K users in Year 1 → 25M users in 7 years.

Validation:
We ran surveys with learners like Elena (exchange students, expats) who struggle with pronunciation, motivation, and speaking. Over 80% said they want more speaking practice and realistic conversation scenarios.

Product
As simply as possible: How does it work?
What does your product do for customers?
What can your customers do as a result of your product?
What opportunities do you provide for people to be faster, more cost-effective, more efficient, happier, safer?
How have you tested it with customers?
(Be sure not to let the product dominate the pitch.)

#Answer:
LoveLingo is a language learning game where you:
Learn the top 1000 most important words in your target language.
Practice speaking with voice/text AI tutors and simulated scenarios.
Engage in a romance story game, where you date, chat, and live through a virtual life.
Use your voice to control the game world (e.g., “Go to the tree on the right”), enabling immersive and gamified grammar and pronunciation learning.

Game Scenarios:
Romantic dates, cafés, gym, stores, Oktoberfest, Ausländeramt, bus station, job interviews.
Eventually: live multiplayer speaking in a Skype or VRChat-like environment.
Outcomes for Users:
Go from beginner to conversational faster, while having fun.
Build speaking confidence through safe practice and real voice feedback.
Stay motivated through story, social play, and visual rewards.

Product Demo
Live demo? (always risky, but powerful if it works...)
A screenflow movie of a working App convinces this is for real.
Physical product convinces you can execute.
Screenshots are also OK, but can look like a mock-up - moving product on screen is better.
Can you show a real customer using it?

We have a working web prototype (text + basic voice).
Playable scenarios: café ordering, dating scene, etc.
Character responds to spoken input.
Visual feedback for grammar, pronunciation, fluency.
Next: Full demo with minigames, story scenes, and daily speaking practice system.

What’s Unique
Technology/Relationships/Partnerships.
How do you help your customers get results differently to your competition, or alternatives?
What’s new and innovative about your solution?
Show you have researched the market and know what competition is out there.
#Answer:
Story-based + Romance: No other language app uses dating simulation and relationship-building as a learning tool.

Gamified Voice Input: Real-time feedback on pronunciation, grammar, and fluency—not just vocabulary.

Emotional Hook: You want to speak because the story makes you care.

Multiplayer Future: Social VR-like world for speaking with real people, not just AI.

Diverse Team = Multi-language Expansion: Native speakers of German, Chinese, Hindi, Bengali, Odia, English.

We don’t just teach languages. We immerse you in lives, relationships, and emotions—in your new language.

How has your life been affected by this industry?
Why should your audience have confidence that you are driven to do what you promise, no matter what?
NOTE: Why You? can show up in any part of the pitch.
#Answer:
Because we've been there. We’ve struggled to say the right words at the visa office, to order food in another country, to connect with people we cared about—but couldn’t communicate with.
We’re building the tool we wish existed when we started.
Not for passive learners—but for people who want to live and love in another language.
